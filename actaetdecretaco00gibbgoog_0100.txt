spring from so bad a root. Honest but vvealr and erring human
nature is apt to be so taken up with one side of a question as to do
injustice to the other; to be so enamored of favorite principles as to
carry thern to unjnstifiable extrenres; to be so intent upon securing
some laudablc end as to ignore the rules of prudenee, and bring about-
ruin instead of restoration. But no intention, no matter how honest,

cau make lawful what is unlawsul. For it is a fundamental rule of Ἰ

Christian nrorals that “evil must not hedone that good may corne of
it,'' and that “the end can never justify the rneans,'' if the means are
evil. Hence it is the evident duty of every reasonable man, before
allowing himself to be drawn into any society, to make sure that both
its ends and its means are consistent with truth, justice and conscience.

ln making such a decision, every Catholic ought to be convinoed
that his surest guide is the Church of Christ. She has in hercustody

rience‚ she sees events and their consequences far more clearly than
they who are down in the tangled plain of daily life. She has seen
associations that were once praisc-worthy, become pernicious by
change of circumstances. She has seen others, which wou the admi-
ration of the world by their early achievements‚ corrupted by power or
passion or evil gnidauce‚ and she has been forced to condemn thern.
She has beheld associations which had their origin in the spirit of the
Ages of Faitlr, transformcd by lapse of time, by loss of saith, and
by the manipulation of designing leaders, into open or hidden
enenries of religion aud human weal. Thus our Holy Father Leo
Xlll. has lately shown that the Masonic and kindred sociales,—

although the otispring of the ancient Guilds, which aimed at sancti-
⁰ fying trades and tradesrnen with the blessings of religion ; and
although retaining, perhapS, in their “ ritual,'' much that tells of the
religionsness of their origin ; and although in sorne muntrioe still
prosessing entire friendliness toward the Christian religion,-have
nevertheless already gone so far, in many countries, as to array them-
selves in avowed hostility against Christianity‚ and against the
Catholic Chnreh as its ernbodinrent5 that they virtually aim at

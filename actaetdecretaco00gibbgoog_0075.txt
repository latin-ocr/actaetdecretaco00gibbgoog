and of appointing (as he has graciously done) an Apostolic Delegate
to preside over its deliberatione.

One of the most important events that our age has witnessed was
the assembling by Pius IX, of happy memory, of the General Coun-
cil of the Vatican. It was held three years aster the close of our

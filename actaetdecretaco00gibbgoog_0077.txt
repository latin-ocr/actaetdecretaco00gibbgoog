take eourage and be valiant. ⁵. . Behold I command thee, take

oourage aad be strong. Fear not aad be not dismayed, became the
Lord thy God 10 with thee'' (losue i., 6, 7, 8, 9). The latter clause

’ gives the reason why we should take oourage and be strong. An

intermediate verse givos the means 01 securiug God's assistance:
“Let not the book of this law depart from thy mouth, but thou shalt
moditate ou it day and night, that thou mayost observa and do the
things that are written in it.'' Kecp, then, day and night, before
your eyes the Law of God and His teachings through that Holy
Charch that Hc has appointed mother aud mistress 01 all men. Fly
the reading of all infidel books, and keep themfrom your children,
as you would the poison 01 asp or basilisk. Tmeh them that you
aad they, in listcning to Holy Choreb, have the guidauoe 01 Him
who said, “I am the way, the truth and the 1110.” Lot others doubt
or deny, but with the Apostle, you know whom you have believed,
and you are certain that He will make good the trust you have
reposod in Him (11. Tim. i., 12).

Christ our Lord commissioned His Apostles to teaeh mankind the
truths they had been taught by Him. They received no oommaud·
ment to write 00 any doctrine, much less to draw up a body 01
articles 01 saith such as our children now learn from the catechism.
They preaehed and taught by word 01 mouth ; or, when oeoesiou
offered itself, they wrote aa the Divine Spirit prompted them. What
they wrote and what they delivered by oral instruction are equally
God's Word. And this two-sold Word, written aud uuwrittemis
the Deposit 01 divine truth, committed 10 the keeping 011110 Catholia
Chareh, aud chiefly 10 him on whom the Charch was built—the only
Apostle who, in the full sense of the words, yet lives and rules in the
person of his suceessors, aud who, 11010 his unfailing ehair, imparta
to all who seek it the 11011101 Christian saith (see Epist. S. Petri
Chrysalogi inter Epp. S. Leonis Μ.) 11 10 1110 office to confirm his
brethrcn, and the history of the Chareh exhibite him, from the
beginning and through all ages, as faithfully fulfilling the charge en·
trusted to him by his Master (Luke xxii, 32). From the earliest ages
down to onr own, the voire 01 Ρο101 has been foremost 10 oondemn-

iug all deviatione from apostolic doctrine. No threats 01 worldly
power could subdue or silence that 00100. To sueh tlneats Peter,
through his successore, has ever given the same answer that he gave
at Jerusalem to the assembled priests and ancieuts (Acts iv, lta-20).

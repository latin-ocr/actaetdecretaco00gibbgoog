His Divina Son; to present them to each generation in the way that
will move their minds and hearts 10 embraoe and love them 3 1ο
defend them, when necessary, against every attack of error. From
this it is obvious that the priest should have a wide acquaintance with
every department of learning that has a bearing on religione truth.
Hence in our age, when so many misleading theorias are put forth on
every side, when every department 01 00111101 trnth and fact is actively
explored 101 objections against revealed religion, it is evident how
extensive and thorough should be the knowledge 01 the minister 01
the Divino Word, that hc may be able 10 show forth worthily the
beauty, 11100111101101111,1110110000011)1 cf the Christian religion, and 10
prove that there is nothing in all that God 1100 made tc contradict
anything that God has taught.

podsible holy, zealons, hard-working priests, to supply 1110 nceds of
the multitndcs calling for the ministratione of religion. She has not
on that account neglected 10 prepare them for their divine work by a
snitable education, as her numerous and admirable seminarias testify 3
but tho course 01 stndy was ostcn more rapid and restricted than she

desired. At present our improved circumstances 10011011 practicable
both tc lengthen and widen the course, and 101 11110 the Conncil has
dnly provided.

We arc confident, beloved brethren, that you feel as deeply inter·

ested as oursclvcs in the accomplishment 01 these great results. This
yon have hitherto manifested by the zcalons liberality by which you
have enabled us 10 build and support our 0010100110ος and we are
well assmed that yon will not be found wanting, should even greater
efforts be necessary, 10 enable us to make the 0010001100 and nsefulncss
01 the clergy as perfect as we desire. In the future, as in the past,
look npon your annual contribution 10 the Seminary fund as one of
your most important dntics as Catholics, and let your generosity be

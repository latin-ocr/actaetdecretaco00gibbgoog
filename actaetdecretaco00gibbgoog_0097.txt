of irreligion. The result is the lamentable desacration which all
Christiana must deplora.

And the consequences of this desecration are as manifest as the
desecmtion itself. The Lord's Day is the poor man'e day of rast3 it
has heca taken from him,-and the laboring classes are a seething
volcano of social discontent. The Lord's Day is the home day,
drawing closer the sweet domestic ties, by giving the toiler a day
with wife and children; but it has been turned into a day of
laben-and home ties are fast lesing their sweetness and their hold.
The Lord’e Day is the churchday, strengthening and consecrating
the hond of brotherhood among all men, by their kneeling together
around the altars of the one Father in heaven ; hut men are drawn
away from this blessed communion of Scins-and as a natural
consequence they are lured into the oountcrt'eit communion of
’ Socialism, and other wild aud destructive systema. The Lord's Day
is God's day, rendering ever nearcr and more intimate the union
between the creature and his Creator, and thus ennobling human life
in all its relations 3 and where this hond is weakened‚ an effortis

In this country, there are tendencies and influences at work to
bring about a similar result3 and it behooves all who love God and
carc for society, to see that they be checked. As usual, greed sor
gain lies at the hottom of the movement. Even when the pretence
put forward is popular convenience or popular amusement, the
clamor for larger lihcrty does not come eo much' from those who
desire the convenience or the amusement, as from those who hope to
enrieh themselves by supplying it. Now far be it from us to
advocate such Suaday-lawe as would hinder necessary work, or
prohibit such popular enjoyments as are consistent with the sacred-
ness of the day. It is well known, however, that the tendency is to
rush far beyond the bounds of necessity and propriety, and to allege
these reasons only as au excuse for virtually ignoring the sacreduess
of the day altogether. But no commuuity can afford to have either
gain or amnsemcnt at erich a eost. To turn the Lord's Duy intoa
day of toil, is a blighting curse toa country; toturn it into a day of

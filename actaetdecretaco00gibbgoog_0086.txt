practicable, it is our desire, not less than that of the Holy See, that
they should go iuto effect. For we have the fullest confideuoe in the
wisdom with which the Churoh devised these laws, and we heartily
rejoioe at every approach towards perfect organizatiou in the portion
of the vineyard over which we have jurisdiction. This has been to
some degree accomplished by regulations enacted during recent years,
aud still more by the decrees of the present Council. .

But while it is our desire to do all on our part that both justice
and affection mn prompt, for fully securing all proper rights aud
privileges to our priests, let us remind you, beloved brethreu, that on
your conduct must their happiness chiefly depcud. A grateful aud
picus flock is sure to make a happy pastor. But if the people do not
respond to their pastofs zeal, if they are oold and ungrateful and
disedifying, then indeed is his lot sad and pitiable. Sinos, therefore,
the Priests of God leave all things to devote themselves to your
spiritual welfare, show by your affection, by your co-operation with
their efforts for your spiritual improvement, and evep by your care

as your best friends, your turstiest advisers, your suroet guides. If
duty sometimes calls upon them to admonish or rebuke you,
remember that the reproof is meant for your good, and take it in
the spirit iu which it is given. And if perchauoe they have to speak
to you ofteuer than is pleasant about church finantes aud the .
demands of charity, understand that it must be at least as disagree-
able to them as it is to you; that it is not for themselves, but for
the needs of the parish church or school, which are intended for your

benefit, or of the parish poor, who are your charge, that they have to ·

plead3 aud that, while they are to beer iu mind the advisability of
speaking of money as seldom as possible, you must be miudful to
make your generosity equal to the need, and thereby save both your
pastore aud yourselves the painful necessity of frequent appeals.

And here we deem it proper to say a few words concerning church
propertius and church debts. The manner of holding tho legal title
to these properties is different indifferent plaoes, according to the
requirements of looal civil laws; but whether the title be held by .
the bishop, or by boards of diocesan or parish trustem, it always
remains true that the properties are held in trust for the Church for
the benefit of the people. One generatiou buys or builds, another

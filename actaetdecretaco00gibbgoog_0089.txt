make him not oulyclever but good. A one-sided educetion will
develop a one-sided life; and such e life will surely topple over, and
so will every socinl system that is built up of such lives. Trne civili-
zation requires that not only the physical and intellectnnl, bnt also

’ the moral aud religione, well-being of the people should be improved,

and at lcnst with eqnal cure. Take away religion ticin a people, end
morality will soon follow; morelity gone, even their physiml condition
will cre long degenerate into the corruption which bmds decrepitnde,
while their intellectuel atteinments would only serve ss a light
to guide them to dceper depths of vioe end ruin. This hns been so
osten demonstrated in the history of the pust, end is, in fact, so self-
evident. that one is smnzcd to find any difference of opinion about it.
A civilitation without religion, would be a civilizstion of “t-he
struggle for existence, and the survivsl of the fittest‚'' in which cun-
ning ancl strength would become the substitutes for principle, virtue,
conscience and duty. As e matter of fact, there never hes beene

Hence edumtion, in order to foster civilitation, must foster religion.

unfortunately, while evowing that religion should be the light end
the atmosphere of the home and of the Church, are content to see it
excludcd from the school, end even advocate as the best school system
that which necessarily excludes religion. ch surely will deny thet
childhood and youth nre the periods of life when the character ought
especially to be subjected to religione influenoes. N or cun we ignore
the pnlpnble fact thet the school is an importent factor in the forming
of childhood and youth-so importent that its influence when not
harmonizing with the influenoes of home nnd Church, isosten found
to outweigh and neutralize them both. It cannot, therefore, be
desireble or advantageous that religion should be excluded from the
school. On the contrary, it ought to hethere one of the chief ngen-
cies for meulding the young life to all that is true end virtuous, and
holy. To shnt religion ont of the school, end keep it for home end
the Church, is, logically‚ to train up ageneration that will consider
religion good for home und the Church, bnt not for the praeticnl

business of real life. But a more false und peruicions notion could

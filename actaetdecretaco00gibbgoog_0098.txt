dissipation would be worse. We earnestly appeal, therefore, to all
Catholics without distinction, not only to take no part in any move-
ment tending toward a relaxation 01 the observanoe 01 Sunday, but
to use their influence and power as citizens to 100101 10 the oppusite
direct-ion.

There is 000 way 01 profaning the ‘Iord’s Day which is so prolific
of evil results, that we consider it our duty to utter against it a
special condemnation. This is the practice 01 selling beer 00 other
liquors on Sunday, 0001 frequenting places where they are sold.
This practice tends more than any other 10 turn the Day 01 the Lord
into a day 01 dissipation, to use itas 00 occasion 100 breeding intem-
perance. While we hope that Sunday-laws on this point will nothe
relaxed, but even more rigidly enforced, we implore 011 Catholics, ·
101· the love 01 God andos country, never to take part in such
Sunday traffic, nor 10 patronize nor countenanoe it. And we not
only direct the attention 01011 pastcrs to the repression 01 this abuse,
but we also 0011 upon them to induce all 01 their flocks that may be
engaged in the sale 01 liquors to abendon as soon as they can the
dangerons traffic, and to embrace a more becoming way 01 making a
living.

And here it behoovcs us 10 remind our workingmen, the bone
and sinew of the people and the specially beloved children 01 the
Chureh, that if they wish to observe Sunday as they ought, they
must keep away from drinking places 00 Saturday night. Carry
your wagcs home to your families, where they rightfully belong.
Turn adeas ear, therefore, 10 every temptation 3 and then Sanday
will be a bright day 100 011 the family. How much better this than
to make it a day 01 sin 100 yourselveS, and 01 gloom and wretched-
ness 100 your homes, by a Saturday night’s folly or debauch. No
wonder that the Prelates 01 the Second Plenary Council declared
that “ the most shocking standals which we have to deplore spring
from intemperance.'' N o wonder that they gave a special approval
10 the zeal 01 those who, the better to avoid excess, or in order 10
give bright example, pledge themselves to total abstinence. Like
them we invoke a blessing on the cause 01 temporanee, and 00 011
who are laboring forits advancement in a truc Christian spirit.
Let the exertions 01 000 Catholio Temperanee Societies meet with
the hearty co-operation 01 pastors and people; and not only will
they go 101· towards strangling the monstrous evil 01 intemperance,

2. rue Iadioaolability ο] Macrim-The security of the Christian
home is in the indissolubility of the marriage tie. Christian mar-
riage, once mnsummatad, can never be dissolved save by death. Let

it bc well understood that ewen adultery, though it may justify
“separation from bed and board,'' cannot loose the marriage tie, so
that either of the parties may marry again during the life of the

the home sanctuary, the incense of prayer should ascend as a most
sweet morning and evening sacrifice to the Lord. How beautiful
and rich in blessings is the assembling of parents and children for
morning and evening prayerl Our hearts are filled with consolation
when, in the course of our pastoral visits, we meet familias in which
this holy practice is faithfully observed. In such families, we are
sure to find proofs of the special benedictione of heaven. Faith,
religion and virtue are there fostered to luxuriant growth, and final
perseverance almost assured. We earnestly exhort all parents to ¹
this salutary ermom. And if it he not always feasible in the¹ morn-
ing, at least every evening, at a fixed hour, let the entire family be

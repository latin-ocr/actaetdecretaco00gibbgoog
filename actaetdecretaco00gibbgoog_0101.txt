where they are aa yet far from aoknowledging such ptuposes, they
aevertheless have iu them the germs, which, under favorable circum-
stances, would‘ inevitahly blossorn forth in similar results. The
Charch, corrsequcntly, forbids her children to have any connection
with streh societies, because they are either aa open evil to be shanned
ora hiddcn daugcr to be avoided. She would fail in her duty is she
did not speak the word of warning, and her children would equally

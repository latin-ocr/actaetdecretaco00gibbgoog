And here we remind those among our Catholio people to whom

God has been pleased to give wealth, that it is their duty and their
privilege to consider themselves the Lonl's stewanls, in the use of
what His Providenee has placed in their hands3 that they should be

wise lawS, based upon the experieuee of centuries, und representing
the perfectiori of Cbnrch organization. It is obvious that in ooun-
tries like our own, n here froin rudimentary beginnings our organiza-

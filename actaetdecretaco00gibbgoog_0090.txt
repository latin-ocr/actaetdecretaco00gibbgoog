not be imagined. Religion, in order to elevate a people, should
inspiro their whole life and rule their relations with one another.
A life is not dwarfed‚ but ennobled by being lived in the presence of
God. Theoefore the school, which principally gives the knowledge
fitting for practioal life, ought to be pre-eminently under the holy
influenoe of religion. From the shelter of home and school, the
youth must soon go out into the busy ways of trade or traffic or
professional practice. In all these, ¹the principles of religion should
animate and direct him. But he cannot expect to lmrn these princi·

hot lie within the province of the State to teach religion. They
simply follow their conscience by sending their children to denomin-

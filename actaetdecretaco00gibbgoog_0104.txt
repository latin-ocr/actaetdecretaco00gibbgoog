We likewise consider as worthy of particular encouragement
associatione for the promotior of healthful social uniou among
Catholioe,—and especially those whose aim is to guard our Catholic
young men against dangerous influences, and to supply them with
the means of innocent amusement and mental culture. It is obvious
that our young men are exposed to the greatest (langere, and there·
fore need the most abundant helps. Hence, in the spirit of our
Holy Father Leo XIII, we desire 10 see the number of thoroughly
catholic and well-organized associatione for their benefit greatly
iucreused‚ especially in our large citiec3 we exhort pastors 10 consider
the formation aad careful ‹lirection of such societies as one of their

With paternal affection we bestow our blessing upon all these
various forms of combined Catholio action for useful and holy pur·
posce. We desire 10 see their number multiplied and their organiza-

tion perseeted. We beseech them 10 remember that their success aud Ι

usesulness must depeud, iu a great measure, upon their fidelity to the
spirit of the Chureh, and on their guarding earesully against influ-

people are united in good worka, the more abundantly will those
associatione be blessed aud their ends be accomplished, the more pcr-

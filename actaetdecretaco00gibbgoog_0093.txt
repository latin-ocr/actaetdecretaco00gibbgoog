assembled for night prayers, followed by a short reading from the
Holy Scripturas, the Following of Christ, or some other pious book.

4. Good Radius-Les the adoraments of home be chaste aad
holy pictures, and, still more, sound, interesting and profitable books
No indelicatc representation should ever be tolerated in a Christian
home. Artistic merit in the work is no excuse for the danger thus
presented. No child ought to be subjected to temptation by its own
parents and in its own home. But let the walls be beautified with
what will keep the inmates in mind of our Divine Lord,and of His
saints, aud with such other picturas of the great and the good as will
be incentivos to civic and religious virtue

The same remark applies equally to books and periodicals Not
only should the immoral, the vulgar, the sensational novel, the
indecently illustrated newspaper, aad publicatione tendiug to weaken

Christian parents, that the development of the youthful characteris
intimatoly connected with the development of the taste for reading.
Of books as well as of associatione may be held the wise saying:
“Show me your company and Ι will teil you what you are.'’ See,
then, that none but good books and newspapers, as wellas none but
good companions, be admitted to your homes. Train your children
to a love of history and biography. Inspire them with the ambition
to beroam so well acquainted with the history and doctrines of the
Church as to be ableto give an intelligent answer to every honest
inquiret. Should their surroundings <all for it, encourage thern, as
Ἴ they grow older, to anprire such knowledge of popularly mooted

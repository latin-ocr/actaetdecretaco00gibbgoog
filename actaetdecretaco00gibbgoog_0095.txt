XC CONCILIUM PLENARIUM BALTIMORENSE 111.

amongst us without a eoneet version of the Holy Scripturas Among
other versions, we recommend the Douay, which is vener-able as used
by our forefathers for three centuries, which eomes down to us sauc-
tioned by innumerabis authoritatem, aud which was suitably anno-

tated by the learned Bishop Challoner, by Canon Haydoclr, aud
especially by the late Archbishop Keuriek.

But in your reading remember the admonitiou of A’Kempis: “The
Holy Scriptores must be read in the same spirit in which they were
writtent—if thou wilt derive profit, read with humility, simplicity
and faith'' (Bk. 1., ch. v.). And keep ever before your mind the
principle laid down by St. Peter in the first chapter of his second
Epistlc: “ Understauding this first, that no prophscy of Scripture is
made hy private interpretation, for prophecy came not hythe will of
man at any time, hut the holy men of God spoke, inspired hythe
Holy Ghost.'' And this other given hy st John, in the fourth
chapter of his first Epistle, in the name of the Apostolic teaching
Church: “Dearly beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits
if they be of God. . . We areof God ; he that knoweth G0d‚heareth
us; he that is not of God hemeth us not; by this we know the spirit
of truth and the spirit of error.'' In these two divinely inspired
rules you have always a sure safeguard against the danger of error.

earnest' consideration of this important truth, that upon you, singly
and individually, must practically depend the solution of the question,
whether or not the Catholic prese is to accomplish the great work
which Providenoe and the Church expect of it at this time So
frequently and so foreibly has the providential mission of the presa
been dwclt upon by Popes and prelates and distinguished Catholic
writers, and so assiduously have their utteranees been quoted and
requoted everywhere, that no one certainly stands in noed of argu-
ments to bc convinced of this truth. But all this will bc only words
in the air, unless it <an be brought home to each parent and made
practical in each household. If the head of eaeh Catholie family
will recognize it as his privilege and his duty to contribute towards
supporting the Catholie prees, by subscribing for one or more
Catholie perialiculs, and keeping himself well acquainted with the
information they irnpart, then the Catholic presa will be sure te attain
to its rightful development and to aeconiplish its destined mission.
But choose a journal that is thoroughly Catholie, instructive and

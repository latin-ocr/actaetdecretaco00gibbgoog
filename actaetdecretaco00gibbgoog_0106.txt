Propagation of tho Faith in every parish in which it is not yet
merted, and also ordered a collection to be made yearly in all the dio-
ceses, for foreign missions and for the missiohs among our Indians
aud Negroes. We have done this through a deep serpe of duty, aud
we trust that our noble-hearted people will not regard it as a burden
imposed on them, but as an opportunity presented to them of co-opera-
ting in a work which must be specially dear to the Heart of Our Lord.

These are the leading matters, venerable and belcved brethren,
which have engaged our attention during this Council. The objects
cf our deliberatione have been the same that have occupied the
energies of the Church and her pastore ever since the days cf the
Apostles,—namely, the extension of the kingdom of God, the build-
ing up the Body of Christ, the giving greater “ glory to God in the

’ highest, and peace on earth to men of good will,'' by shedding

abroad more abundantly the blessings cf religion, and the graces of
redemption. Our legislation is not intended to impose burdens cr
limitatione upon you, hut, on the contrary, to enlarge and secure to
you “ the liberty of the children of God.'' The pathos duty and
virtue is clearly marked and pointed out, not to restrain your free-
dom, but that you may journey safely, that you may live wisely aud
virtuously, that you may have happiness temporal and eternal.

And now we write you these things, that you may be partners in
our solicitude, that every hcart may cry out “Thy Kingdom come ;”
that every hand may be active in confirming and extending it.
Acccpt with willing and loving hearts these lessons which spring
from hearts full of love for you, and entirely consecrated to your
service. Give joy to us aud to our Divine Lord by putting them
faithfully in practice. And may the blessing of Almighty God,
the Father, the Son, and the Hcly thst, descend upon you abund-

antly, aud abide with you forever.

The duties of a Christian begin with his own honsehold and his
own parish ; hut they do not end there. The charity and 0001 10
010 heart must be like that in the heart 01 100 Church, whose very
name is Catholic,—like·tlrat in the heart 01 Christ, who “ died for all‚''
and “who gave Himself a redemption for all '' (11. Cor. v.‚ 153
1. Tim. ii., 6). Το0 Divine commission 10 100 00οι00 0100010 for-
ever: “ Go, teach all nations3 preach the Gospel 10 every creature ;''
and every 000 who desiras the salvation of souls, should yearn forits
fulfilmeut, and consider it a privilege to take part in its realization.
The more we appreciata the gift 01 10110, 100 more must we long to
have it imparted to others. The heart of every true Catholic must
glow as hc reads of the heroic labors 01 our missionarioe among 0001000
0011000 10 every part 01 100 world, and especially among the Indinn
tribea 01 our country. The missionary spirit is 000 01 100 glories 01

and we were unable to take any important part in aiding the
missione ahroad. But we must beware lest our local burdens should
make our zeal narrow and uncatholia There are hundreds 01
millions 01 00010 10 0001000 100010 10 whom the light 01 100 Gospel
has not yet been carried, and their condition appeals 10 100 charity 01
every Christian heart. Among our own Indian tribes, for whom we
have a special responsibility‚ there are still many thousands in 100
100 same darkness 01 henthenism, and the missione among our
thousands of Catholic Indians must equally look to our charity for
support. Moreover, out 01 100 six millions of our colored popula-
1100 there 10 0 very large multitude, who stand sorely 10 00001 01

the poor dioceses in which they are mostly found, it is most difficult
10 bestow on them the care they need, without the genereus

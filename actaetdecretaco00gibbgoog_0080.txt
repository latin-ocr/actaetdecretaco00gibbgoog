as the early Christiano held firmly to the divinity of the Son and of
the Holy Ghost three hundred years before the Cliurch found it
necoffiary to define them in the Councils of Nice and Byzantium.

And in our own country, writers and speakers who know the
Ohurch only by the caricatures drawn by prejudice, have occasion-
ally re-echoed the same charge3 but despite local and temporary
excitements, the good sense of the American people has always
prevailul against the ‹alumny We think we can claim to be
acquainted both with the laws, institutions and spirit of the Catholic
Church, and with the laws, institutione and spirit of our country3
and we emphatically declaro that there is no antagonism between
them. A Catholic finds himself at home in the United State ; for
the influence of his Church has constantly been exercised in behalf
of individual rights and popular liberties. And the right-minded f
American nowhere finds himself more at home than in the Catholic

We repudiate with equal earnestness the assertion that wc need to

of ordinary intelligcnce. We believe that our country's heroes were
the instrumente of the God of Nations in establishing this home 01

we look with grateful reverence3 and to maintain the inheritance 01
freedom which they have left 00, should it ever-which God forbid—
be imperilled, our Catholic citizens will bc found to stand forward as
one man, ready to pledge anew “ their lives, their fortunas and their
sacred honor.''

No less illogical would be the notion, that there 10 ought in the
free spirit of our American institutione, incompatible with perfect

docility to the Church of Christ. The spirit of American freedom is

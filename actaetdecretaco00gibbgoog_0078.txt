No pleading 01 princes and potentates could ever wm Rome's
sympathy for error; no heresy under false semblanoe of Catholie
truth ever yet eluded her vigilant eye (Cf. St. Cyprian, Ep. lia).
As soon as any novelty appeared, all hearts and eyes were turned
towards the Chair of Peter, and when that Chair gave its decision,
Christian people yielded obedienee. Those who would 1101, were cut
off from the communion of the Church, and hemme thenecforth as
the heathen and the publiean. ⁹

This doctrine, therefore, which had so thoroughly wrought itself
11110 the life and action of the Church, the Vatican Council deemed
proper to consecrate hy a solemn delinition. Hence, that no one in
future may craftily pretend not 1οζ11110111, how and whenoe 10 aseer-
tain what the Church officially teaches ; above all, that no one may
henoeforth 0001101 the baneful seeds of false doctrine with impunity,
under thc maslr of an appeal from the judgment of the Holy See
(whether it be to learned universities, or State tribunale, or future
oouncils, particular or general, as was done by Luther and the J an-
senists), the Church of the living God, through the Fathers 01 the
Vatican Council, has unequivocally declared that her authentic
spokesman is the successor of St. Peter in the Apostolio See of
Rome, and that whatever he, as Head of the Chmoh, defines aa

Christ Our Lord, and henee is subject 10 neither denial, doubt nor
revision, but is 10 be implicitly received and believed by all.

In this· authoritative declaration there is nothing new, nothing
10 give cause 101 wonder. It is only setting the solemn seal of
definition upon what has always been the belief and practice 01 the
Chureh. Yet “the gates of Hell,'' the powers of darkness that
forevcr aasail the Chureh built on Peter-though knowing that they
01111101 prevail against it nor make void God's promise (Mattlr. 1111,
18)-000111 10 have been stirred 10 the very depths by the proclama-
tion of this great truth. And their impetent rage has found its echo
upon earth. The definition evoked a storin of ficrce obloquy and
reckless vituperation, such as has been seldom witnessed amongst our
opponente. And a wretched handful of apostate Catholics “went
out from us, but they were not of us” (1. J ohn ii., 19).

But, what was far more serious, the kings of the earth stood up
and the princes assembled together against the Lord (Acts iv., 26)
and against His anointed Vicar, because 011110 delinition. They

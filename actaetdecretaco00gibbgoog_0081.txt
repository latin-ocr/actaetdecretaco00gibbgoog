· notone of anarchy or of linense. It essentially involves love of order,
respect sor rightful authority, and obedience to just laws. Thereis
nothing in the character of the most liberty-leving American, which
could hinder his reverential submission to the Divinc authority of
Our Lord, or to the like authority delegated by Him to His Apostles
and His Chureh. N or are there in the world more devoted adherants
of the Catholic Church, the See of Peter, and the Vicar of Christ,
than the Catholics of the United Status. Narrow, insular, national
views and jealousies concerning ecclesiastieal authority and Church
organizution, may have sprung naturally enough from the selfish pol-
icy of certain rulers and nations in by·goue timoe3 but they find no
sympathy in the spirit of the true American Catholic. His natural

the powers of evil have been at the Council’s luminous utteranccs of
Divino truth, our Holy Father the Pope hos been, naturally enough,
the main object- of attack. And Divine Providence has been pleased
to leave him for a while at the merey of his enemim, in order that
their impious violence might work out the demonstration of its own
injustiam that the true character and the indestructibility of the office -
of St. Peter might be made manifest to the world; that the wisd0m
of the Providence which has guardcd the independence of that office
in the past, might be vindicatcd and reatlirmed sor the future. The
great and bolorad Pius IX. died the “ Prisoner of the I'atiffln,’' and

Lco XIII. has iuherited his Aprstolic trials, together with his Apos— '

is the age in which we live. This is pre-eminently an age of action,
and what we need to-day is active virtue and energetic piety. Again
and again has the voice of the Vicat of Christ been heard, giving
approval and encouragement to many kinds of Catholic associatione,
not only as a cetegum against the allurements of dangerous societies,
but also as a powerful means of aoeomplishing much of the good that
our times stand in need of. Not only should the pastore of the
Chureh be hard at work in building up “the spiritual honse''
(1. Pet. ii„ 5), “the tabernaclo of God with men'' (Apoc. xxi, 3),
but every haud among the people of God should share in the labor.

In the first place, we hope that in every parish in the land there is
some sodality or confraternity to foster piety among the people. We
therefore heartily endorse anew all approbations previously given to
our many time-honored and cherished oonfmtemities, such as those
of the Sacred Heart of J esras, of the Blessed Sacrament, and of the
Blessed Virgin.

Next come the various associations for works of Christian acal and
charity: the Society for the Propagation of the Faith, and the Holy
Childhood, than which there are none more deserving3 societioe for
the support of Catholic edumtion3 Christian doctrine societies for

‘ the work of Sunday-sohools3 societies for improving the condition

of the poor, among which stands pre-eminent the Society of St.
Vinoent de Paul ; ehurch-debt societies3 societies for supplying poor
churehes with vestments and other altar requirements5 local sanctuary
societies ; audather methodsof uniting the efforts of the people of the
pnrish for useful and holy purposes It ought ta be the comfort and
the honest pride of every Catholic to take an active part in these
good works; and if any are hindered from contributing a portion of
their time and labor, they should contributa as liberally as they mn
out of their pecuniary resources.

Then there are associatione for thc checking of immorality, promi-
nent among which are our Catholic Temperanoe Societies. These
should be encouraged and aided by all who deplora the scandal given
and the spiritual ruin wrought by intemperanoe. It is a mistake to
imagine that such societies are made up of the reformed victims of

intemperance. They should be, and we trust that they everywhere

am, largely composed of nealous Catholics who never were tainted
with that vice, but who mourn over the great evil and are energetimlly
endeavoring to correct it.

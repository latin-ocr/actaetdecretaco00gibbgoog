inspired the decrees 01 those venerable Fathers and to listen with
cheerful submissius to their authoritative voice, whether uttered in
warning, in exhortation or positive enautment. And the whole
American Ohurch deeply 10010 and oerdially proclaims her gratitude
for the treasure bequecthed to us by their wise and timely legislation.
Its framers, in great part, have gone before us with the sign 01 Faith
and now sleep the sleep 01 peace. But their work, besides following
them 10 the dread tribunal of the great J udge to plead in their behalf
and insure their reward, has remained upon earth as a safe guide end
a rich blessing for the clergy and people of their generation.

Since that time, however, the body of our clergy and religious has
grown 10 wonderful dimensione, our Catholic institutions have been
multiplied tenfold, with a corresponding increase in the number of
our faithful laity. The territory likcwise, over which they are
spread, has been greatly enlargcd. The land of the far West, that
once was desolate and impassable, through God's providential mcrcy,
now rejoiees and flourishes like the lily. Under His guiding hand,
it has been taught to bud forth and blossom and rejoioe with joy and

prioeless perfume of the “ Clean Oblation,'' foretold by Malachi, daily
aseends toheaven, and where the life-giving sacraments 01 Holy Church
are dispensed by a devoted clergy. In view of this grcat progress of
our holy religion, this marvellous widening of the tabernacles of
Jacob, ithae been judged wise and expedient, if not absolutely neees-
sary, to examine anew the legislation 01 0111 predecessore, not with any
purpose of radical change, much less of abrogation, but to preserve
and perfect its spirit by adapting it 10 our altered circumstances.
And as every day gives birth to new errors, and lapse of timeor

distance 01 place allows abuses to gradually crcep into regular dis«
cipline, we have judged it the duty of our pastoral office 10 check the
latter by recalling and enforcing established law, and to guard our
flock against the former by timely words of paternal admonition.

Such, too, has been the expressed wish and injunction 01 our Hol y
Father Leo XIII.‚happily1-e1gning,to whom, as Suprema Pontitf

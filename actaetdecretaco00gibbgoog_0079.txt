lXXlV CONCILIUM PLENARIUM BALTIMORENSE 111.

revivsd the old warory raised by the Jews against our Savionr
(John xia, 12, 15), and so osten renewed by the persecutore 01 the
Ohurub. They pretended that by defining the infallibility of St
Petere suooessor‚ she had made herself the enemy of Cesar. Herein
we see plainly verified the strong language of Scriptum: “ Iniquity
bath lied to itself'' (Ρο. xxvi„ 19). The Pope, even aster the pro-
clamation 01 his infallibility, is no more the enemy 01 Caesar and 01
humair governments, than was the infallible Peter the enemy 01
Nero, or Christ our Lord‚ who is infallible truth itself, the enemy
01 Augustus aad Tiberius, under whom He was born into tbe world
taught and suffered. The govemments by which, three oenturies
ago, the new teneto 01 Lutber, Zwingli and Calvin had been imposed
on reluctant peoples by the sword‚ were the first, indeed the only ones,
to again unsheathe it against Catholie believers, and especially against
bishops and olergy. It was their purpose to exterminate by degrees
“ the Catholio hierarohy‚ and replaoe it by a servile priestbood that
would subordinate its ministry and teaahing to the will of the State.
To do this they bad to trample on solemn treaties and organio lawa.
But the Catholioe 01 Prussia, olergy and people, while proving them-
selves most devoted and faithful to their oountry's laws, stood up
like a wall of ’ alemant against the tyranny 01 its rulers. With
generous vigor and admirable oonstanoy, they availed themselves
01 *every legal and oonstitutional means to ebech the advaneas 01
despotism, and save their own freedom and that 01 their oountry.
They have given to the world a glorious example, which it is to be
hoped the victims of tyrannous Liberalism in Catholio countries may
some day have the wisdom or the oourage to imitate. The struggle
has now lasted sourteen years ; but the very friends 01 this perse-
euting legislation have been driven at last to aeknowlodge that it has
proved to be a miserable failure3 and no better proof 01 it oould be
found than the 1001 that the rulers 01 Prussia have had to fall bae-k
on the patriotism of the Catholio body to stay the threatening mamb
01 socialism and revolution. In Switaerland, too, the perseurtion
has yieldod to the polioy of mildness and eonciliation adopted by Our

Holy Fatber, Leo XIII.
Beloved brethren‚ we have no need to enoourage you to hold
